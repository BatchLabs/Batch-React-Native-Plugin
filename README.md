# Batch React-Native Plugin

The Batch React-Native Plugin allows you to build meaningful communication experience in your Android/iOS app through highly personalized push notifications & In-App messages.

Our [ðŸ“• setup documentation](https://doc.batch.com/react-native/prerequisites) details the steps to take for an easy and successful integration.

# Prerequisites

As this plugin is built over Batch's Native SDKs, their respective Android and iOS requirements apply.

# Documentation
- [Setup guide](https://doc.batch.com/react-native/prerequisites): start your implementation here!
- [Help center](https://help.batch.com/en/): answers to most questions you may have during the integration
- [API reference](https://batchlabs.github.io/Batch-React-Native-Plugin/): this documents each of the classes and methods in the Batch React-Native Plugin

# React Native architecture
Batch ships a TurboModule implementation for the React Native New Architecture.
The legacy bridge is still bundled for compatibility but is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
Enable the New Architecture to keep receiving updates.
